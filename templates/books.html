        <p><strong>
                 Maybe you have always felt that there is more to life,
                 maybe you were the one who was never pleased with the information you found about topics that mattered to you,
                 topics about life, spirituality, meaning of Life, a better world, how is our brain functioning and many more.
        </strong></p><br>
        <p><strong>
                LifeBook's reason is to help you find books that can change your life, recomended by people just like you. 
                You can also create an account and upload the books that made your life better, books that you think others should
                know about, and you can also tell them the reason why they should read your recomendation.
