### Design Choices
---
* The goal for this site was to create a simple and easy to use platform, that expresses calm and relaxation and a simple and easy to use system.

### Colors
---
Main colors are **Orange** / **Teal** and **Light-Orange**. Most of the website is **Light-Orange** and **Teal** to give the feeling of something relaxing and calmness, the **Orange** color is used in the Navbar and Footer and ads a nice touch to create a contrast and define the elements.

### Fonts
---
I have used Indie Flower as the font for the most part of website, to give it a relaxed look. And the standard Arial for the forms and other text, as is clean and easy to read.

### Structure
---
In the upper part there's a navigation menu, which contains the name of the page "Life Book" in the left side , then in the right side whe have 3 pages "Home, Login and Register"(and 4 pages "Home, Log Out, Profile, Add Book" once you are logged in).
On the **Home** page, we have a descriptive image of a book in nature and under that we have **What is Life Book**, with some information about what we are all about, and underneath there's a  **Search Bar** and then the **Library** and at the bottom of the page the **Footer**.
Then The **Login** page, displays a form with the required steps to login, and the **Register** page , which displays another form with the username and password and the register button.
Next there's the **Logout** page that logs the user out, disaplys a message that the user has been logged out and redirects you to the log in page.
**Profile** page is user's page and will have more features in the future.
Then we have our **Add Book** page where you will find a form for adding a new book to the website.

1   bugs found
 1. I was doing the register function and it wouldn't update the database , i found out that i have written the methon adn action attributes in child div instead of the form .
 2. the contant of the books was displayed in lower letters ..... i have used a jinja expression that wrapped the library in 
    {% filter upper %}
    
    {% endfilter %}
 3. photo in what is lifebook was not displaying correctly it was displaying on the left side of the div..... i have used  display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;    and now is displayed on the center.
